They feel a subtle wooden grain under their fingertips (medium\u2010fine ridges and slight roughness). As they grip the lid\u2019s front lip and lift, they encounter a smooth but firm hinge resistance: an initial catch followed by steady torque as the lid swings open. At the top of the travel there\u2019s a faint \u2018stop\u2019 or click sensation as the hinge reaches its limit. A good physical proxy is a small wooden box with a functioning hinge and simple latch, so users feel both the wood grain and the opening resistance."

A suitable proxy is any ordinary metal key or a small, smooth metal ring: it provides the same slim profile, ring-shaped hold, and slick surface."

A slight kickback vibration is felt against the web of the hand at the moment of \u2018fire.\u2019 A toy trigger mechanism or a plastic pistol replica with a spring-loaded trigger makes an ideal proxy, matching the trigger pull force, click feedback, and grip shape."

When they toss it, they notice the low mass and inertia: it shifts easily in the hand and requires only a gentle acceleration to launch. A standard plastic disc or lightweight lid edge serves as an excellent proxy, giving the same thin-rim profile and light throw weight."

Swings produce a shifting center of mass and inertial torque in the wrist. A real metal\u2013wood hammer or weighted training hammer with a heavy head and round wooden or rubber handle gives the correct heft distribution and handle feel."
