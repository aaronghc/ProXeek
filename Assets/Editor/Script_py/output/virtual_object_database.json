Reaching up to lift the lid, they encounter a hinged resistance\u2014an initial stiff detent followed by a smooth pivot and a light metallic click at the end of travel (high interactivity). A good physical proxy is a small wooden box with a real hinge and latch: it provides the same grainy wood texture under the fingertips and realistic hinge torque and click."

A good proxy is an actual brass or steel skeleton key with the same ring diameter and slender shank: it preserves the smoothness, ring shape, and tactile cues of the teeth."

The grip itself can be smooth plastic or metal but the key sensation is the crisp trigger response. A good proxy is a toy or training pistol that has a realistic metal trigger mechanism\u2014providing the precise pull weight, travel distance, and audible/tactile reset."

The handle\u2019s round outline (40% outline) must fill the palm. A well-chosen proxy is a real hammer or mallet with a heavy metal head and wooden or plastic round handle: it replicates the off-center mass and heft needed for realistic swings."
