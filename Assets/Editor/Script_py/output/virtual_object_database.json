    "hapticFeedback": "When you reach out and press on the lid of the treasure chest, you should feel a slightly coarse wood-grain surface under your fingertips, with the subtle raised ridges of the planks and the occasional nail head indentation. As you grasp the front edge or the metal hasp, you get a sharper, colder metallic snap. Pulling the lid upward brings a low-pressure friction at the hinges: a smooth but noticeable resistance that \u2018clicks\u2019 into a detented open position. No overall weight shift should occur (the chest is fixed), but the lid\u2019s hinge should impart a small tactile \u2018stop\u2019 to signal it\u2019s fully open. A good physical proxy is a small wooden box with real metal hinges and latch, lightly sanded to leave visible wood grain and a hinge mechanism that offers gentle resistance and an audible click."

Your thumb and index finger curl through the circular bow (ring-shaped holding part), which has a thin, uniformly rounded edge. The shank is narrow and cylindrical, leading out to the toothed bit: there you feel the distinct flat facets and sharp sawtooth pattern under mild finger pressure. A suitable proxy is a standard brass key blank\u2014ring hole up front, slim shaft, and real machining on the teeth so you can feel each notch."

    "hapticFeedback": "Grasping the pistol, your hand settles around a matte-finished grip that feels firm but untextured. Key interaction comes from the trigger: you should feel an initial spring tension as you pull, a well-defined \u2018break\u2019 point where the trigger snaps back, followed by a crisp click. Upon release, the trigger returns smoothly under spring tension. A good proxy is a lightweight plastic or metal toy gun with an operational trigger mechanism that replicates the pull-and-snap action with moderate resistance."

    "hapticFeedback": "The Frisbee should feel like a thin plastic disc: lightweight in your hand with almost no inertia, easily pinched between thumb and fingers. The rim is only a few millimeters thick but rounded, so when you flex it slightly you get a small bending sensation. The top and bottom surfaces are smooth, with just enough stiffness that the disc holds its shape but yields a bit under strong pinch. A standard plastic flying disc (real-world Frisbee) is an ideal physical proxy."

As you rotate, you encounter steady, low-torque resistance that simulates mechanical friction in a car\u2019s steering column; turning one way or the other should require constant, gentle pressure and deliver continuous haptic feedback of rotational drag. A real automotive wheel or a simulator wheel with adjustable friction is the best proxy."

As you compress further, the object deforms noticeably, and a squishy, fluid-like resistance builds before the structure collapses. A well-filled silicone stress ball or a water-balloon-style object encased in a thin rubber skin makes an excellent proxy for this smashable, compliant feel."

The handle is smooth and cylindrical (\u22482 cm diameter), filling your palm comfortably. When you lift or swing, you feel the center of mass strongly toward the hammerhead end, creating a torque in your wrist. The head itself is rigid and dense under impact, delivering a sharp impulse on contact. A small machinist\u2019s hammer or tack hammer\u2014with a solid metal head, round handle, and the same head-heavy balance\u2014is the ideal physical proxy."
