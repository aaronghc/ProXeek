They should feel the subtle raised pattern of wood grain under their fingertips (medium grain height and spacing), the solid resistance of a wooden panel when pushing or pulling on the lid edge, and a distinct click or small bump as the hinge reaches its open/closed detent. A good physical proxy is a small wooden box (~0.6 m \u00d7 0.35 m \u00d7 0.5 m) with a functional metal hinge and a visible wood-grain finish so users can experience both the texture and the lid\u2019s opening resistance."

The key\u2019s ring-shaped head provides a precise tactile outline: a seamless circular profile with a small gap for fingertip insertion. An ideal proxy is an actual house key or a metal key-fob ring: roughly 0.06 m thick at the loop, rigid and smooth, so users get the correct sense of outline and surface finish."

The grip should feel firm and comfortable, the barrel and slide surfaces hard and temperature-neutral. When the user presses the trigger, they should feel initial spring tension, then a sharper \u2018break\u2019 as the trigger clicks over, followed by a short, sharp vibration simulating recoil. A suitable proxy is a toy or dummy pistol with a working trigger mechanism and a bit of mass in the barrel to transmit feedback, so users can feel both trigger resistance and a brief kickback."

They should feel the narrow edge thickness (a few millimeters), a slight springiness when they squeeze the rim, and the low overall weight when they accelerate it for a throw. The tactile outline is that of a thin, uniform ring; the disc surface itself is not gripped. A real plastic frisbee or ring-shaped lid (\u223c0.27 m diameter) works well as a proxy, providing the correct inertia, thin-plate outline, and slight flex under pressure."

A steering-wheel replica (or a bicycle handlebar ring) with a diameter of about 40 cm and a lightly textured grip surface is an excellent proxy to reproduce both the outline and the interactive rotation feedback."

On full compression, a subtle change in resistance reminds them of the flesh inside. A soft foam ball or a stress-ball shaped and sized like a tomato (\u223c0.17 m diameter) provides the correct softness and deformability for users to experience the smashable feel."

A solid metal or weighted toy hammer with a heavy head and smooth wooden or plastic handle (~0.25 m \u00d7 0.42 m overall) makes a good proxy by delivering the correct inertia distribution and outline of the handle."
