The lid\u2019s edge and latch area should convey the coarse grain of weathered wood under the fingertips\u2014slight ridges and grooves along the planks\u2014as well as the smooth, cool inlay of any metal bands. Contact will occur primarily on the front lip of the lid and the latch. A good physical proxy is a small wooden box with an actual hinge: the user must push against wood grain friction and feel the metal hinge\u2019s resistance and endpoint click."

A good proxy is any real house key or similarly sized smooth metal fob: it conveys the ring-shape holding part and slim shank."

The index finger on the trigger experiences an initial light preload followed by a distinct break and a crisp tactile \u201csnap\u201d as the trigger is pulled. Contact parts are the grip\u2019s contours and the trigger itself. A suitable proxy is a toy or airsoft pistol frame with a working trigger: it provides the same pull force curve and clear mechanical break."

Contact is around the circumference between thumb and fingers. A standard plastic flying disc serves as an ideal proxy, matching the thin-plate outline and low weight."

As they rotate, there is a low-torque, gently damped resistance\u2014no hard stops, but subtle feedback from internal friction. Contact is continuous along the top half of the rim. A small automotive steering wheel or bicycle handlebar section bent into a circle offers a good proxy, providing the same rounded profile and rotational feel."

There is no hard surface\u2014only a smooth, uniform compliance. Contact occurs across the palm or fingertip pads. A soft stress-ball or squishy toy with a smooth outer membrane is an excellent proxy, matching the same softness and elastic deformation."

The weight feels biased toward the head, producing a clear forward moment when swung. There is low handle compliance and a solid endpoint when the head contacts a surface. Primary contact is on the handle just below the head. A short metal-headed hammer or mallet with a straight wooden or metal shaft closely replicates this weight distribution and handle outline."
