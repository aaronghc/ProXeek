    "harmony_explanation": "The paper provides a slight give and muted thud, which aligns with the expected soft resistance and slippery collapse, but may not fully capture the squishy feedback.",
    "expressivity_rating": 5,
    "expressivity_explanation": "The paper provides a slight give and muted thud, simulating the soft resistance and slippery collapse effectively, but lacks the full richness of feedback expected from a tomato.",
    "realism_rating": 4,
    "realism_explanation": "The paper provides some give that simulates the soft resistance of the tomato, but the muted thud lacks the wetness expected from the virtual interaction."
